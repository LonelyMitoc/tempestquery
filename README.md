## **Description**

Here we have created a simple weather dashboard that will save your searches as buttons below the search side bar and the user is able to recall the data by clicking on the desired city button.

The difficulty with the project was to get the correct information from the API and displaying them in the appropriate containers. Additionally, I was unable to set it up to change the displayed weather data by a set interval because each update would use up a request and we do not have infinite requests.

Additionally, I was able to delete the 'null' data that would present itself during the recall of the past cities however, I was unable to prevent the program from producing a blank button (I would like to be able to fix this in the future).

## **Features**

- Date and Time shown in the heading with the time updating each minute.
- Search in the sidebar and results on the main body page for easy reading.
- Once the search button is clicked, the search is saved and displayed as a button below the search bar.
- The current weather with temperature, wind speed and humidity as well as a weather icon is displayed at the top of the result page along with the city in which the data is shown for.
- Below the current weather shows the 5-day forecast with the date, temperature, wind speed and humidity as well as the weather icon.
